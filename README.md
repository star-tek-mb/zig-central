`zig-central` - is a package registry for zig. https://central.decoy.uz

# Status

Status early alpha development

# TODO

- Check for zig package manager compatibility

- Show package dependency if any (scan `build.zig.zon`)

- Show available artifacts (static/shared library) or modules of dependency

- Version history (based on tags?)

- Search, pagination

- Compute hash of package (we can borrow algorithm from zig source code, but i want a zig cli for computing hash)

- Rewrite in Zig? :-)
